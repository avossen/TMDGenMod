Welcome to the new TMDGen (prerelease version).  Currently, TMDGen is
not released to the public, and is copy-written by the University of
Michigan with all rights reserved.  Work is in progress to release
TMDGen publicly under a GPL.

If you are reading this, you must have successfully received the source
code.

In order to install, edit the file Makefile.in to ensure that the
correct options are selected, especially the directories for any
external libraries.

Compiling with Root output can be selected via -UUSE_ROOT or -DUSE_ROOT

Typing 'make' will make the executables within the sub-directory 'bin'
and libraries within the directory 'lib'.

Ensure that these are included in your path and ld library path, and
then you can execute TMDGen via

TMDGen <instruction_file> <number_of_events>

Example instruction files are found in the 'Example' directory.  A
more complete list of commands can be found by grepping 'find', as in

grep find *.d/*.cpp

The file VALID_INTERNAL_NAMES lists the valid names for distribution
and fragmentation functions.

Further documentation is forthcoming....

Dependencies:

For root, make sure you also have the physics development headers.
Forexample, on a debian system, the command

sudo apt-cache search root physics dev

shows that the needed headers can be installed via

sudo apt-get install libroot-math-physics-dev
